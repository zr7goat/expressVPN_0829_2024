ExpressVPN doesn't support users downloading the .deb installer directly with command line only. Instead, they need users to download only with GUI, which is a non linux native approach.
This repo has the installer on ubuntu 20.04+ linux version with amd64 bits, updated on 08/29/2024, only for research purposes.
FYI: this repo is never for profit and you still need to 1) pay for a subscription of expressVPN and 2) do the steps after the installer is downloaded on your linux device: https://www.expressvpn.com/support/vpn-setup/app-for-linux/#command-line
